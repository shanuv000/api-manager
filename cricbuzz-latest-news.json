Across 14 Tests at the ground, he has taken 63 wickets at an average of 25.36, repeatedly exploiting the surface as it wears over five days. He now needs just two more wickets to overtake Glenn McGrath as Australia's second-highest wicket-taker in Tests, with only the late Shane Warne ahead of him.\n\nAsked about the looming landmark, Lyon reflected on the symmetry of the moment. \"I daresay it would be like a little fairy tale, I guess, with my history here (at the Adelaide Oval). My first ever Test match here was on the roller here back in 2010, funnily enough against England. So for me to potentially overtake Glenn McGrath [here] would be pretty incredible.\"\n\nDespite his record, opportunities for spin in Australia have been limited of late. Lyon has bowled only eight overs across his last two Tests at home, sending down six overs against India at the SCG and just two in the Ashes opener in Perth, as seam-heavy attacks continued to dominate selection thinking.\n\nThat context puts the nature of pitches on centre-stage, a subject close to Lyon's heart. So how important is it for spinners to receive some assistance? \"You're asking a spinner - I think it's incredibly important,\" Lyon said. \"I think the variation in Test cricket, understanding that Test cricket goes for five days, and there's a lot of opportunity for pitches to wear and spinners to be able to produce their craft.\"\n\nExpanding further on spin's place in the modern game, Lyon underlined its wider appeal. \"I've always said as soon as the ball spins, there's more eyes on TVs. You look at when we go over to India, you look at the conditions there and the exciting cricket when the ball is spinning, how many people pay attention to it.\n\n\"Spin is incredibly important in the game of cricket, in junior cricket, in first-class cricket, in white ball, red ball - it doesn't matter what format,\" stressed Lyon.",

      "content": "Harry Brook admitted that the first two Tests of the Ashes series hadn't quite gone to plan for him, conceding that his usually sharp feel for tempo and situation has deserted him at key moments. England's vice-captain said he has struggled to strike the right balance between absorbing pressure and forcing the issue.\n\n\"It hasn't been an ideal series,\" he said two days out from the Adelaide Test. \"Sometimes, I've got to rein it in a little bit: learn when to absorb the pressure a little bit more, and realise when the opportunity arises to put the pressure back on them. I feel like I haven't done that as well as I usually do. I just haven't identified those situations well enough.\"\n\nBrook explained that much of his aggression has come in response to England losing early wickets, with his intent often shaped by the need to wrest back momentum rather than play within himself. It worked in the first innings in Perth when he top-scored with a 61-ball 52 but that approach hasn't quite paid off thereafter with scores of 0, 31 and 15 since.\n\n\"Most of the time when I've been overly aggressive is when we've lost early wickets and I've tried to counter-punch and put them back under pressure. I tried to do that in Perth in the first innings: I played quite nicely and gloved down the leg side.\"\n\nWhile Brook believes his reading of the game remains sound, he accepted that the execution which defined his early international career hasn't quite been there in this series. He also acknowledged that two of his dismissals, caught behind driving at a back-of-a-length ball in Perth, and edging a big drive off Mitchell Starc in the first innings in Brisbane were \"shocking shots\".\n\n\"I try to read situations as well as possible, and then it all depends on my execution. And so far [in this series], my execution hasn't been as good as it has been at the start of my career.\n\n\"They were shocking shots,\" Brook added. \"I'll admit that every day of the week, especially that one in Perth: it was nearly a bouncer and I tried to drive it. It was just bad batting. The one in Brisbane, I've tried to hit for six.\"\n\nThose moments, Brook felt, illustrated the need for greater restraint and an ability to trust rotation rather than forcing big shots. \"That's what I mean when I try to say that I need to rein it in a little bit. I can almost just take that and hit it for one and get down the other end. Whoever else is in with me at the other end can just get on strike and just keep trying to rotate.\n\nEven so, Brook said he would not dwell on regret, only on learning from those moments. \"I'll be the first person to stand up and say that they were bad shots. I don't regret them, but if I was there again, I would try and play it slightly differently.\"\n\nBrook, however, tipped his hat to the relentless accuracy of Australia's bowling attack, saying they had offered very little margin for error. \"You can't take this bowling attack lightly: they very rarely miss,\" he said. \"You've got to try and create your own bad balls. Doing that might be me running down; it might be me changing my guard or whatever. Look, they don't miss often and you've got to tip your hat to them sometimes. They've bowled really well in this series.\"\n\nSupport for Brook has remained strong within the England camp, with master batter Joe Root offering a glowing endorsement of his Yorkshire teammate on the Sky Sports Cricket podcast. \"He can kill teams with a whisper,\" Root said. \"Harry Brook is a generational player, and he is going to deliver at some point in this series. You watch out. He is a match-winner. If he gets himself in and set at some point in this series, he's going to go and do something very special for us.\"\n\nRoot compared Brook's ability to influence games to that of Kevin Pietersen. \"It's a bit like Pietersen. He does things that other players can't do. That's the reason why he averages 55, and why he's done so many special things in his short career until now: because of his mind, and the way that he reads the game.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Brook said the team's mid-series break in Noosa had helped them step away from the intensity of an Ashes tour and reset ahead of the third Test. \"We tried to stay away from cricket as much as possible. We just wanted to go there and have a good time,\" he said.\n\n\"We had a belting time, and it probably came at the right time when we're two-nil down. I know most people won't think that, but to get away from the game and try to refresh as much as possible after a tough start to the series, hopefully that can help us leading into this game.\"\n\nThe visitors, down 0-2 in the series, will make one change to the team with Josh Tongue replacing Gus Atkinson for the Adelaide Test.",

Bangladesh are scheduled to play six white-ball games against New Zealand in April, and their participation in the IPL may therefore be limited.\n\nThere are seven Bangladesh players in the auction register, with base prices ranging from Rs 2 crore to Rs 30 lakh, but only Mustafizur Rahman has a realistic chance of being considered by IPL teams. However, if national commitments intervene, even Mustafizur may feature only as a replacement at a later stage, as he did last year.\n\nMustafizur (base price Rs 2 crore), Rishad Hossain (Rs 75 lakh), Taskin Ahmed (Rs 75 lakh), Tanzim Hasan Sakib (Rs 75 lakh), Nahid Rana (Rs 75 lakh), Rakibul Hasan (Rs 30 lakh) and Md Shoriful Islam (Rs 75 lakh) have made it to the final list of the auction register.\n\nThe BCCI is expected to brief the franchises on the availability of overseas players at the pre-auction meeting, scheduled at the W Hotel in Abu Dhabi on Monday evening (December 15).

The BCCI is expected to disclose the new names at the briefing with the franchises on Monday evening, but it is understood that Abhimanyu Easwaran's name has been added to the spreadsheet.\n\nEaswaran, the captain of Bengal, was in the initial list after being recommended by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) with a base price of Rs 30 lakh, but his name was missing from the final list of 350 players released recently. However, it is understood that his name has been forwarded again by a franchise and that he is among the late entrants to the register.\n\nEaswaran (30) is primarily considered a red-ball specialist, but this year he played a couple of stellar knocks in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT). In seven SMAT innings, he scored 266 runs at an average of 44.33 with a strike rate of 152.

The 11-over game saw Sixers post 113/5 on the board before Scorchers hunted it down with five balls to spare following a blistering half-century from Cooper Connolly.\n\nRain threatened to play spoilsport on the opening night of the 15th edition before finally relenting for a 5:35 PM start. It took Scorchers just three deliveries to strike as Aaron Hardie sent Daniel Hughes to the pavilion early. While Josh Philippe hit a couple of boundaries to get the Sixers going in the following over, BBL debutant Babar Azam didn't last long as he miscued a pull shot to depart for just 2.

Connolly however took little time to settle down as he smashed just his third delivery for a six. Finn Allen then took on Edwards for a couple of sixes in an over as Scorchers went toe-to-toe with their opponents.\n\nAfter Allen's dismissal, Hardie effortlessly kept the scorecard ticking with more boundaries before his dismissal at the halfway mark ensured the game was tantalisingly poised. Connolly then shifted the balance once again with successive sixes off Todd Murphy before clearing the ropes again in the following over to bring up his fifty.

      "content": "England head coach Brendon McCullum has backed Jofra Archer's intensity and ruled out any 'knee-jerk' changes to England's settled top seven, pushing back against growing scrutiny following the Brisbane Test defeat.\n\nArcher came under the spotlight on the final day of the Day-Night Test when he bowled the fastest spell of his career and even indulged in verbals with Steve Smith at a time when Australia were chasing a fourth-innings target of 65 runs. There were questions raised - including by James Anderson - about the absence of sustained hostility when Australia were racking up 511 runs in the first innings.\n\nMcCullum defended Archer's approach, pointing to the realities of fast bowling and the danger of judging intent purely through speed. \"Jofra is good,\" McCullum said. \"He can say what he wants but if you mope around bowling 75 mile an hour in that last innings then the narrative [would] be very different right in the end.\n\n\"The skipper asked our boys to not mope around and not to feel sorry for yourself and we haven't been outplayed in this game but we have an opportunity over 60 odd runs to fire some bullets and see where we land. I have no problem with him stepping up to that level. It is impossible to bowl 150 odd every single time here.\"\n\nMcCullum suggested Archer's easy action can sometimes mask the effort and tactical control behind his spells. \"The thing about Jofra is a very good ability to be able to go through the gears and because he's got an easy action as well I think it can often be misinterpreted as bowling within himself. Sometimes you need to bowl within yourself as well to be able to reduce your level of missing and to be a little bit more accurate and try and give yourself the best chance to zero in. Dale Steyn is a great example of that.\"\n\nDrawing on historical parallels, McCullum said Archer's ability to shift gears was a strength rather than a concern. \"Some of the old West Indian boys back in the day they used to operate up and down the gears as well and Jofra will be no different in this Test match when he gets the chance. I think he's been really good he hasn't had a lot of luck so far. He's all in.\"\n\nBeyond pace and confrontation, McCullum highlighted Archer's workload and off-ball effort as evidence of his investment. \"He bowled 25 overs the other day and chased the ball as hard as I've seen to the boundary on two occasions. He didn't run it down but that's the level of investment, the level of engagement and the level of commitment that Joff's got. That's what we expect from him.\"\n\nMcCullum also played down speculation over changes to England's batting order, despite Ollie Pope's inability to make it count with a big score from No.3 and Jacob Bethell waiting in the reserves. \"From our point of view we've had a top seven now for a period of time and we've been reasonably successful with it. These conditions should suit the style of batters that we've got as well,\" McCullum said.\n\nWhile conceding England have not scored enough runs in the series so far, the head coach framed the issue as one of execution rather than selection. Continuity, he said, remains central to England's approach. \"We know we haven't got enough runs so far in the series. We've been in positions where we could have and we've made mistakes. That can happen at times.\n\n\"But for us to go on and win the series it's not about throwing out what's been a successful for us over the past few years. It's about having more conviction. It's about making sure that we have our plans and our disciplines around it screwed down a touch more. It's making sure we walk out and we're part of the loop and what we're capable of achieving. Knee-jerk reactions and chopping and changing settled batting line-ups is not really our way.\"",

      "content": "England head coach Brendon McCullum has clarified that his post-Brisbane comments about England possibly having \"overprepared\" were aimed primarily at protecting the dressing room, stating that internal messaging can often be interpreted differently in the public space.\n\n\"Yeah, there's a couple of elements to it,\" McCullum said. \"First of all, what you're saying to your dressing room is you're trying to evaluate where the team's at, at the end of a Test match, and at the end of a loss knowing that you have nine days before you need to go back out into the arena. So the messages to the guys are always a matter of trying to shift the focus forward as well... you're trying to shift it forward so that your confidence levels don't dip. Because when they do you have no chance. Absolutely no chance. So what you say to them and then what you say in the media can be quite different.\"\n\nMcCullum reiterated that shielding players remains central to his role, even if it places him under greater scrutiny. He also stressed that his reference to being \"over prepared\" was not a critique of work ethic, but of how England managed their energy after a difficult loss.\n\n\"In terms of being over prepared, it's not about working the hardest. Working the hardest doesn't guarantee you success. Working the longest doesn't guarantee you success,\" he said. \"What I meant by us being over prepared is we had five intense training sessions. In my opinion we almost we left ourselves a fraction short in terms of our energy and our ability to play what was in front of us, which on that wicket required quite a different game to necessarily what your training needs.\n\nMcCullum pointed to adaptability as the key skill required in Australian conditions. \"You have to think on your feet. You have to be able to manoeuvre your game. You have to be able to identify risk.\n\n\"If you over prepare or you over train based on how many balls you hit on a true surface it can leave you a little bit ill prepared in that moment. There is no perfect preparation... That's not how it works but for me I think you need an edge about when you enter a game.\"\n\nThat edge, he said, comes from freshness, something he accepted responsibility for misjudging. \"You need to be mentally fresh. You need to be physically fresh. And five intense training sessions on the back of a difficult loss [in Perth] I don't think necessarily gave us our best chance. And I'll wear that. I'm happy to wear that as leader. It's best if the focus is on me not the others.\"\n\nAsked whether his position was under threat if he was not able to engineer a comeback in this Ashes series, McCullum remained unconcerned. \"I don't know, but it doesn't really bother me to be honest. You have conviction in what you're doing and whatever happens, happens. I certainly don't coach to protect a job. I coach to get the best out of people and that's the same with the skipper.\"\n\nThat conviction, McCullum insisted, would not change with the series on the line. \"We'll remain committed to what we're doing. I firmly believe if we play our best cricket, we have a massive chance in this Test match. If we do that, then the narrative changes and the series momentum changes but it's all in front of us to achieve in the next few days.\"\n\nHowever, McCullum acknowledged that this Ashes series, seen in some quarters as the final destination in the 'Bazball' journey that began three years ago, could shape perceptions of his tenure but maintained faith in the broader plan. \"We came here with high hopes and high expectations. We haven't quite executed that so far and Australia receives those key moments and hence they sit 2-0 up. It doesn't mean that we throw that plan out.\n\n\"Now, if anything, we just need to chisel away at some of the things we haven't got quite right, this is probably more attuned to our best style of cricket. Yeah, of course, the fact we're 2-0 down, we've made it harder on ourselves but that won't stop the belief that you have within the dressing room.\"\n\nWhile the score lines in the two Tests have been emphatic, McCullum felt England had not been completely outplayed. \"I don't think we've been anywhere near our best so far. What's been has been. For us now it's not a matter of fighting the war that's been, it's focusing on the one that's coming.\n\n\"The conditions here at Adelaide are going to be quite different. [We need to] just be a little more calculated when we get the opportunity to be able to put the foot on the throat.\"",

There were also other reports that suggested fitness concerns as a bowler.\n\nHowever, Green, who goes in with a maximum base price of INR 2 Crore and is expected to be the most expensive player in this edition of the auction, said his listing as a batter was not by design but because of a simple administrative error from his manager.\n\n\"I don't know if my manager will like to hear this, but it was a stuff-up on his end,\" explained Green. \"He didn't mean to say batter, I think he accidentally selected the wrong box, so it was pretty funny how it's all played out, but it's actually a stuff-up on his end. I'll be good to bowl.\n\nWhen asked if he'll follow the auction, Green said: \"I'm sure I will be, with a few other guys. They're always good fun to watch. It's a bit of a lottery where you might go, but also who might be in your team, so it's always been fun to watch.\"\n\nMeanwhile, bringing the focus back to the Ashes, Green said he is expecting to bowl more overs in the remaining Tests compared to only 16 overs bowled across the first two Tests so far.\n\n\"Any overs you can bank up your sleeve in the early games will be beneficial later because I'll obviously be required later in the series when everyone's a bit more tired. Happy to keep the overs at what they are, but I'm certain they're going to get increased the next few games,\" he said.",

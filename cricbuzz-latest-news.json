There were also other reports that suggested fitness concerns as a bowler.\n\nHowever, Green, who goes in with a maximum base price of INR 2 Crore and is expected to be the most expensive player in this edition of the auction, said his listing as a batter was not by design but because of a simple administrative error from his manager.\n\n\"I don't know if my manager will like to hear this, but it was a stuff-up on his end,\" explained Green. \"He didn't mean to say batter, I think he accidentally selected the wrong box, so it was pretty funny how it's all played out, but it's actually a stuff-up on his end. I'll be good to bowl.\n\nWhen asked if he'll follow the auction, Green said: \"I'm sure I will be, with a few other guys. They're always good fun to watch. It's a bit of a lottery where you might go, but also who might be in your team, so it's always been fun to watch.\"\n\nMeanwhile, bringing the focus back to the Ashes, Green said he is expecting to bowl more overs in the remaining Tests compared to only 16 overs bowled across the first two Tests so far.\n\n\"Any overs you can bank up your sleeve in the early games will be beneficial later because I'll obviously be required later in the series when everyone's a bit more tired. Happy to keep the overs at what they are, but I'm certain they're going to get increased the next few games,\" he said.",

While the likes of India, England and Australia already have their own league now, the has PCB decided to take a go-slow approach in this regard to make sure they leave no stone unturned.\n\nPCB women's wing head Rafia Haider, who visited Bangladesh recently to accompany the Pakistan Under-19 squad during their just concluded tour, in an exclusive chat with Cricbuzz insisted that they want to make sure everyone is on the same page before launching the tournament.\n\n\"It(franchise-based T20 tournament for women cricketers) is under discussion but not finalized as yet,\" said Rafia. \"Of course it (the tournament) is going to be a huge move whenever it happens so we'll take everyone on board and do our homework properly before its fruition,\" she said.\n\nRafia added that they are taking different steps to develop women's cricket in Pakistan that includes grassroots expansion to high-performance reforms. \"We are taking different initiatives to develop women's cricket in Pakistan. Recently we have dedicated the High-Performance Centre in Karachi for our Women's Cricket, where they attend their camps and train round the year. Women's U19 team was given separate team management and that HPC facility, where they prepared for the Bangladesh tour and we have seen good results right away. Separate team managements have been given to the national team and U19/emerging teams for focused player development,\" she said.\n\n\"Now we are eyeing to have school cricket for girls. It will help us develop a vaster pipeline for women's cricket which we feel is essential to develop the growth of women's cricket in the country,\" she further added.\n\n\"We have challenges and we are ready to face those challenges. For us taking women cricket to grass root level is the biggest challenge and we are making plans to overcome those challenges through school and U15 tournaments planned in future. We are trying to establish the pathway that would help us have a strong pipeline as we feel if we can nurture these Under-19 cricketers they will go a long way but our biggest challenge is to have the right pathway so that we are producing cricketers to fill the void from national level to age-level. We have regularized domestic tournaments for U19 and senior/emerging side and now focusing on u15 and u23 tournaments to keep players engaged.\"\n\nRafia said that the PCB is fully supporting them to grow women's cricket with many people starting to embrace it. \"Our management (PCB) is supporting us fully and we are getting whatever is required so we can certainly say women's cricket is an integral part of PCB. The commitment and support by the Board is commendable and we have made great strides in past two years under current management,\" she said.\n\n\"More importantly people are embracing women's cricket like nowadays parents bring their daughters to learn cricket and it indicates we are culturally also embracing women's cricket.\"\n\nEven though Pakistan did not have a successful campaign at the World Cup recently, Rafia insisted that the results didn't reflect the country's true potential. Pakistan lost four games in the tournament while three matches were abandoned. In 2025, Pakistan played 15 matches winning only six of them.\n\n\"Although we failed to earn success we came quite close against some of the big teams and couple of matches were abandoned so we cannot say we have failed in the World Cup. What we feel is that now we need to develop for high pressure/high stakes environment and be consistent because this is one area proabably we are lacking behind and we are working on to make sure we have a fitter unit in the coming days,\" said Rafia.\n\n\"The World Cup result does not show our true potential considering in 2025 we played 15 matches winning six matches with three being washed out,\" she said.\n\nRafia added that they will continue to support Fatima Sana, who replaced Sana Mir as captain, as she feels she got all the credentials to be a good captain. \"Fatima is a good leader and we are happy with her performance as a captain.

The AL1 category is second in the auction order to come under the hammer.\n\nThe only other player with a suspect action is Abid Mushtaq of Jammu and Kashmir, a 29-year-old left-arm spinner with a base price of Rs 30 lakh. KL Shrijith, a 29-year-old off-spinner from Karnataka (No. 354 on the auction list), is banned from bowling in the IPL; he was placed under the ban last season itself.

Although an MI spokesperson did not offer a comment, sources indicated that the company would be willing to assist him in any possible way in the future.\n\nPandya's new venture is the Hardik Pandya Family Office, which is being managed by Out of the Park - a celebrity management firm founded by Ritesh Nath, an experienced hand in the field. Nath was previously associated with Cornerstone, a leading celebrity management company that handles many cricketers.\n\n\"I'm excited to share that I'm officially setting up my family office to bring all my business ventures, investments and off-field commitments under one unified version. This is an important step towards building long-term meaningful opportunities on and off the field and I could not be more thrilled about what is ahead. I'm partnering with an incredible team of Out of the Park who will now manage and oversee all my business interests,\" Pandya's November 26 post read.\n\nRISE continues to be the premier talent management company with which the country's top cricketers are associated.

However, about a month ago, the ace India all-rounder set up his own business venture. Pandya was joined in the new initiative by his brother Krunal, who too has exited RISE.",
        "There is no immediate information of Pandya's exit from RISE having any impact on his association with the Mumbai Indians, the five-time IPL champions he captains. Although an MI spokesperson did not offer a comment, sources indicated that the company would be willing to assist him in any possible way in the future.",
        "Pandya's new venture is the Hardik Pandya Family Office, which is being managed by Out of the Park - a celebrity management firm founded by Ritesh Nath, an experienced hand in the field. Nath was previously associated with Cornerstone, a leading celebrity management company that handles many cricketers.",
        "\"I'm excited to share that I'm officially setting up my family office to bring all my business ventures, investments and off-field commitments under one unified version. This is an important step towards building long-term meaningful opportunities on and off the field and I could not be more thrilled about what is ahead. I'm partnering with an incredible team of Out of the Park who will now manage and oversee all my business interests,\" Pandya's November 26 post read.",
        "RISE continues to be the premier talent management company with which the country's top cricketers are associated. Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas Iyer, Tilak Varma, Ishan Kishan and Sai Sudharsan among others are part of it."

He'd said 'Quinny was an enigma, and is still an enigma'. The keeper-batter had retired from ODIs following the World Cup in 2023 and hadn't featured in a T20I since the Men's World Cup in 2024 until the Pakistan series came along.\n\nHe had five quiet outings - one against Namibia in Windhoek followed by three in Pakistan, and a duck in the T20I opener in Cuttack. In Mullanpur however, he rekindled his older, menacing version to slap India with a 57-ball 90 that set up South Africa's massive victory. In the afterglow of that performance, de Kock spoke about finding his hunger to play for South Africa again.\n\n\"I think prior to my retirement, I was losing my hunger to win games for this team, specifically for the Proteas. And that time away just brought back my hunger,\" de Kock said after his match-winning knock in Mullanpur.\n\n\"I was telling the guys that I don't think I've ever felt this way. Whereas before, when you're young, you're trying to just play to score runs and impress. Be part of a team where I feel now that there's a renewed energy where I'm not just playing, I'm playing to win every game with a renewed energy. Where before, it would be hard to wake up and go play for the team again, especially when you play a series over and over where you've played India multiple times, home and away.\n\n\"I think over time that I was getting sick of it because I was looking for a new challenge and I wasn't getting it. Now coming back, I feel like this is actually what I missed. As everyone knows, you never know what you have until you've lost it. So that's kind of now coming back, where that renewed energy where I feel I can play much longer than what I thought previously,\" he added.\n\nUntil Thursday evening's knock, de Kock was looking all at sea in his comeback in T20Is. De Kock admitted he was annoyed with how 'sloppy' he was in the opening fixture and aimed to get into better positions in the second game, particularly while facing India's fast-bowling spearheads.\n\n\"Not much [changed]. I was just trying to get myself into a better position. I think initially I was quite irritated, disappointed with myself. The previous game, the way I got out was very sloppy. I knew if I stood a chance to score runs, just need to look after that in the first couple of balls, especially to a guy like Arshdeep and Bumrah, you have to be strong in your positions or otherwise they are going to find you out. You can't be loose.\"\n\nDe Kock also revealed that staging this return wasn't an overnight decision, and that the break he took was also much-needed when it came. \"I think it was just time away from the international stage. It wasn't a decision that I just woke up and had,\" de Kock said. \"I think over time, the longer break I had, the more I felt ready to come back. I had already played international cricket for more than a decade. That was pretty much it. I think when I left, I was quite exhausted from international cricket.\n\n\"So my break, I still feel, was much needed. Now when I came back, I've got a lot of energy that I can put back towards the team. And I've always said it to coach Shooks [Shukri Conrad], I want to play as long as I can now. I don't think I could have had that mindset if I carried on playing [without the break].\n\nI think I actually would have finished my career earlier. Now with my break, I feel I can prolong my career. I feel fitter than ever. And mentally also, I'm not exhausted. So I feel like I'm happy to be back and I can give more back to the team,\" he added.\n\nDe Kock finding rhythm and runs in this format is a shot in the arm for the World Cup finalists from 2024, as they attempt to go one step further when the next edition comes along in February-March 2026.",

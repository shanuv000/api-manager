The comprehensive triumph has propelled them to the top of Group D, setting the stage for an exciting campaign ahead.\n\n## Dominant Batting Display Sets the Foundation\n\nBatting first at Namibia's High Performance Oval, Afghanistan posted an imposing total of 262/6 in their 50 overs, built on two outstanding individual performances.\n\n### Osman Sadat Anchors the Innings\n\nOpener Osman Sadat played the sheet anchor role to perfection, crafting a patient 88 runs off 131 deliveries. His measured approach provided the stability Afghanistan needed at the top of the order, allowing his teammates to play with freedom around him.\n\n### Captain Mahboob Khan Leads from the Front\n\nSkipper Mahboob Khan delivered a captain's knock when it mattered most, smashing an aggressive 86 off just 69 balls. The wicketkeeper-batter's explosive innings in the middle overs transformed Afghanistan's total from competitive to commanding.\n\n> \"He is very responsible for the team... he's also the keeper and he was leading from the front today. He did really well, so that was the reason we did really well and we won.\"\n\n— Wahid Zadran on his captain's match-winning contribution\n\n## Bowling Attack Dismantles West Indies\n\nWith a substantial total on the board, Afghanistan's bowlers wasted no time in asserting their dominance over the Caribbean batting lineup.\n\n### Wahid Zadran Spearheads the Attack\n\nLeft-arm quick Wahid Zadran was the star with the ball, returning impressive figures of 3/36 from his nine overs. His ability to strike early in the powerplay proved decisive in setting the tone for the bowling effort.\n\n> \"It's always been a pleasure bowling good at the top of the Powerplay. But the team... I always give the credit to the team, the rest I don't care about. So it's very, very good to get the win.\"\n\n— Wahid Zadran\n\n## Fielding Excellence Completes All-Round Performance\n\nAfghanistan's brilliance wasn't limited to bat and ball. Their fielding unit was equally impressive, taking sharp catches and effecting crucial run-outs that kept the pressure on the West Indies throughout their chase.\n\n> \"I give all the credit to our fielders. We took some brilliant catches and made some brilliant stops, which gives the bowlers lots of confidence and lots of energy, so really happy and our fielders are doing well so far.\"\n\n— Wahid Zadran\n\n## Team Unity Drives Success\n\nWhat stood out most in Afghanistan's victory was their collective approach. From the openers setting the platform to the middle-order acceleration and the disciplined bowling performance, every player contributed to the cause.\n\n> \"When the team starts well, it's going well for everyone. Then in the middle, Mahboob played very well, so the total was very fair and went very well for us, so we bowled with confidence and were very good, so overall we were so happy.\"\n\n— Wahid Zadran\n\n## Road Ahead: Eyes on Super Six Stage\n\nAfghanistan now sit clear at the summit of Group D, with their sights firmly set on maintaining their unbeaten run. The young Afghan side faces Tanzania in their next fixture on Wednesday in Namibia, looking to carry their momentum forward.\n\n> \"It was a day that made history, looking forward, because in cricket, every day's a new day. We just want to take the momentum of today to the next game.\"\n\n— Wahid Zadran\n\nWith their all-round capabilities on full display and team spirit running high, Afghanistan have served notice to their rivals that they are genuine contenders for U19 World Cup glory in 2026.",

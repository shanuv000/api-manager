The star all-rounder insists her side can reclaim their dominance after recent ICC heartbreaks, including a T20 World Cup exit and missing the 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup final. With her leadership proven in the **WPL 2026**, where she's retained as **Gujarat Giants** captain, Gardner's confidence signals a fierce comeback. This isn't just talk—it's backed by her explosive form that could redefine **Australia's** fortunes[1][2].\n\n**Ash Gardner**'s career is a testament to all-round brilliance, amassing **1,411 runs** at a **127.69 strike rate** in 96 T20Is, including five fifties, and claiming **78 wickets** at **20.64** average with a best of **5/12**. In **WBBL**, she's scored **2,750 runs** with 14 half-centuries and snared **121 wickets**, including six four-wicket hauls. Her **WPL** stats shine too: **567 runs** and **25 wickets** across 25 games.

Compare to **2023 T20 World Cup**, where her contributions helped **Australia** win; now, post-semi losses, she targets those 'small moments' in finals cricket. Stats show her **WPL 2025** unbeaten **79 off 39** set tones, while off-spin bit at **8.03 economy**—numbers screaming readiness for 2026 redemption[1][2].\n\n### World Cup Stakes and Rivalry Revival\n\n**Australia**'s barren ICC run by their standards—exits to **India** in consecutive semis—amps the pressure, but Gardner eyes the February multi-format series against the new 50-over champs as a tune-up. Same **T20 WC group** means early fireworks. Her retention as first full-time overseas **WPL** captain boosts **Gujarat Giants**' playoff push, mirroring national revival. This trajectory could restore **Australia**'s supremacy, especially with **India** brimming confidence[2].\n\n### Road to England Glory\n\nNext, **Australia** faces **India** in February, post-**WPL**, before Caribbean tours and **T20 WC opener** vs **South Africa** on June 13. Gardner's leadership will be tested in crunch ties—fans must watch if she conquers pressure moments to reclaim crowns.

Thrust into the opener’s role in the first Test, he smashed 123 in Perth, bossed the Adelaide decider with 170 and finished with a classy 163 in Sydney – the kind of relentless volume that reminds Indian fans of peak **Steve Smith** in 2019.\n\nAlongside him, **Zak Crawley** edges into the XI, showing enough promise at the top to convince voters he belongs despite England’s overall meltdown. The structure of the side – two openers, a mix of middle-order batters and all-rounders, a specialist keeper and four bowlers – reflects how fans now value balance and flexibility across formats.\n\nFrom an Indian lens, this reader XI underlines two truths: Australia’s core is settled and scary in home conditions, and England’s next reboot is already overdue.\n\nThe bigger takeaway? If this is the level needed to shine in the Ashes, **Team India**’s next away Test cycle in Australia is going to demand similar, series-defining giants with the bat and ball.","metaDescription":"Discover how fans picked their Ashes 2025/27 team of the series, with Travis Head leading a dominant Australia core and Zak Crawley the lone English opener.","keyTakeaways":["📊 Travis Head topped fan voting after 629-run Ashes haul","🏆 Reader XI dominated by Australian stars after 4-1 win","💡 Fans value balance: 2 openers, 4 all-rounders, 4 bowlers, 1 keeper","🔮 Sets benchmark for India’s next Test tour of Australia"]},{"id":"cmk4xj3oo00023j4pp9rps7g1","enhancedTitle":"Ashes Awards 2025/27: Starc, Head and chaos define brutal series","enhancedContent":"The urn stays in Aussie hands and **Mitchell Starc** walks away as the undisputed player of the series, as this Ashes turned into yet another English nightmare down under.\n\n### Starc’s fire, Head’s hundreds and England’s slide\n\nThis could easily have been the **Travis Head** series – three hundreds, relentless pressure and a tone-setting presence with the bat. But the Ashes was effectively done and dusted in the first two Tests, and that’s where **Mitchell Starc** tore the contest apart.\n\nWith 18 wickets across Perth and Brisbane, Starc channelled those old-school Mitchell Johnson vibes – snarling left-arm pace, late swing, and brutal spells with the new ball that shredded England’s top order before they could settle. Add a crucial 77 with the bat at the Gabba, and he became Australia’s ultimate enforcer in Cummins and Hazlewood’s absence.\n\nFrom an Indian fan’s point of view, it was a reminder of how a world-class left-armer can tilt an entire series – something we still rarely face in Test cricket outside the odd **Shaheen Afridi** burst. Starc at full tilt on hard Australian decks is the blueprint of what **Team India** must counter the next time they tour.\n\nBehind the big awards lies the real storyline: Australia found multiple match-winners, England mostly found problems. In a year where Indian fans obsess over Test supremacy, this Ashes showed that pace, fitness and depth still decide the biggest battles.","metaDescription":"Learn why Mitchell Starc claimed Ashes 2025/27 player of the series, how Travis Head pushed him close, and what this brutal 4-1 result means for Test cricket.","keyTakeaways":["📊 Mitchell Starc grabbed 18 wickets in the first two Tests","🏆 Starc named player of the series ahead of triple-centurion Head","💡 Australia unearthed multiple match-winners, England only questions","🔮 India’s next Aussie tour will hinge on handling left-arm pace"]},{"id":"cmk4xj1g500013j4paxy3n0ah","enhancedTitle":"Ashes Ratings: England futures questioned as Head becomes all-format beast","enhancedContent":"Another Ashes down under, another reality check for **England** – while **Travis Head** walks out of the series looking like an all-format monster any IPL scout would love.\n\n### England’s report card vs Australia’s rising all-format star\n\nThis series confirmed what Indian fans watching late-night sessions already sensed: England’s batting core is fragile, and reputations mean nothing on hard Australian decks.\n\n**Zak Crawley – 5**: Averaging **27**, he did just enough to suggest talent, but nowhere near enough to be inked in for the home summer. For all the talk of backing him for Australia, he never truly imposed himself.\n\n**Ben Duckett – 3**: Came in tagged as one of the world’s premier all-format batters, leaves with his career at a crossroads. No scores beyond 50, missed chances in the field and off-field noise in Noosa – a break, rather than more white-ball grind and IPL temptation, might be the reset he needs.\n\n**Jacob Bethell – 7**: The big what-if. When finally used, he showed the kind of intent and skill that made you wonder how different this tour could have been had he featured earlier. For Indian fans, he’s the sort of dynamic batting all-rounder franchises love to stash for the future.\n\nOn the other side, **Travis Head** has quietly completed his transformation into an all-format force – tempo for Tests, gears for white-ball cricket, and the mentality to boss big moments.

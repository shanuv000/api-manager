Three players in the squad have been knighted.\n\n![Image caption, Ben Stokes (left) and Joe Root (right) are yet to win a Test in Australia](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/49c2/live/b903f120-e0ae-11f0-8516-3db1ae351283.jpg)\n\nNow, Stokes and Joe Root, two other bona fide England legends, are poised to go through their careers without a single win in Australia.

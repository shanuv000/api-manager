**England will investigate reports of players drinking excessively during a break from the Ashes series in the beach town of Noosa.**

The England squad spent four nights on the Queensland coast between the second and third Test.

Several media outlets, including the BBC, reported that some players were drinking for a significant portion of their time in Noosa, as well as on two previous days in Brisbane, the venue for the second Test.

A video was shared on social media on Tuesday which appeared to show England opener Ben Duckett drunk.

Although England produced an improved performance in the third Test in Adelaide, Australia won to take an unassailable 3-0 lead and retain the Ashes in only 11 days of cricket.

"We'll be looking into seeing what the facts are as opposed to the things that have been embellished or elaborated on," England director of cricket Rob Key told BBC Sport.

"Headlines can be misleading at times, saying it's a stag do and stuff like that.

"Stories of players drinking six days solid - that's unacceptable."

In the video, which has not been verified by BBC Sport, Duckett is asked if he knows how to get home. He says "no" and later swears.

The England and Wales Cricket Board said it is "establishing the facts" around the video and that it has "high expectations" around player behaviour.

Duckett was dropped from the England Lions squad during a tour of Australia in 2017-18 after pouring a drink over England bowler James Anderson.

The break in Noosa was arranged before the tour and went ahead despite England falling 2-0 behind after two Tests.

While the entire squad were present in Noosa, former Kent and England batter Key was in another part of Queensland.

Players were told to expect media attention and were captured by TV cameras and photographers.

That included shots of some players drinking at an outside table of a bar on the main high street in the town.

"When you see a picture of five or six guys sitting down for lunch, a couple of them having drinks, you need to see what's going on with that," said Key.

"If it's true that it became a stag do and people are out drinking all the time excessively, that's not acceptable.

"I don't agree with a drinking culture. I don't like a drinking culture."

Former Australia batter and head coach Darren Lehmann told Australian radio station ABC he spent time with some England players in Noosa.

"They were actually really well behaved. They mixed with the locals and had a good time," he said.

"The reports of them on a stag do are just wrong. I will defend them there.

"They played golf, swam on the beach and played soccer with the locals - they were liked by the locals.

"I will defend them a little bit because it is a little bit out of order. I didn't see a stag do. I saw people just relaxing and enjoying Noosa for what it is."

'We've been at about 20% of our capacity'- Key on Ashes defeat

Key said he previously looked into reports that white-ball captain Harry Brook and batter Jacob Bethell were drinking the night before a match on the limited-overs tour of New Zealand that preceded the Ashes.

A clip of Brook and Bethell was shared on social media, reportedly taken in Wellington the night before the third one-day international on 1 November.

"I didn't feel like that was worthy of formal warnings, but it was probably worthy of informal ones," said Key.

"There wasn't any formal action. We've had four years where we've had none of these issues really, with any of the players, and there's a whole process that we put in place for stuff like that - for what you do if they're out of line.

"That was a bit of a wake-up call for what they're going into. I don't mind players having a glass of wine over dinner. Anything more than that, I think is ridiculous."

Despite the questions over the behaviour of some players in Noosa, Key defended their right to take the break from the Ashes.

Brook, Bethell, Ben Duckett, Jofra Archer and others could spend almost six months away from home following the tours of New Zealand, Australia, and the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka in the new year.

"Harry Brook is going to only be at home for six days this entire winter," said Key.

"We have to create a time where these players can get away from cricket because they're not going to do it by being at home.

"We live in an age as well where it's impossible to avoid cricket. I sit there on my phone and every Instagram thing comes up. I know that players say they shouldn't look at it, but they do.

"You can't escape cricket, especially on an Ashes series and the scrutiny. Getting away and being able to just forget about that and live like a normal person is really important."

## 'Drinking in public was dopey'

Paul Farbrace, who was part of England's coaching staff for the 4-0 Ashes defeat in 2017-18, said the Australian media are "so in your face" but that the tourists were "dopey" by drinking publicly in Noosa.

He told BBC Radio 5 Live: "The Australian media cause as much issue for the England cricket team as they possibly can.

"The pressure from everyone around is intense and immense and you do need a break.

"But going to sit in a middle of a high street with lots of people, right near the beach, drinking beers from lunchtime is not a good look.

"They could have done it in private at their hotel or away from the glaring public eye.

"It just adds to the narrative around this team that they are a very arrogant group of people and don't care what people think about them.

"They do care about winning, but they've given so many headlines to so many people. All they've done is set themselves up for a fall and it really is a great shame.

"England are where they deserve to be in this series, but their drinking has not cost them the series - that's the bottom line."

## An issue 'synonymous with cricket tours'

Meanwhile, former England wicketkeeper Matt Prior said he would not condemn the touring party until all the facts were established but also suggested this type of issue is "synonymous with cricket tours".

"There have been reports from people like of Darren Lehmann, the ex Australia cricketer, who loves to get stuck into England at every opportunity and he has defended them, saying he was there and their behaviour wasn't one of a stag do and they got the balance right," Prior said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

"We also have to remember it was a break and it was a planned break. You are allowed to go and have lunch and have a beer. In fact, you have to get away from the game.

"England tours, particularly in Australia, are incredibly pressurised and when you are up against it there is no escape. Nowadays with social media there is nowhere to go.

"Joe Root had his family over and he apparently went with his family somewhere else. That is escapism for him but some of those guys won't have family over there.

"There is a more deep rooted issue for me that is synonymous with cricket tours and players being away from home a long time with the press getting on your back.

"What are you meant to do, go and sit in your hotel room 24/7 and get even more and more depressed?

"This issue, if there is one, is not a new thing. Players struggle and have struggled with this type [of thing]."

England unable to hold out as Australia retain the Ashes

- Published23 December 2025
- 442 Comments

**England are once again left playing for pride and places in the last two Tests of an Ashes series down under.**

Australia have an unassailable 3-0 lead following victory in Adelaide, with matches in Melbourne and Sydney to come.

Using data from analysts CricViz, here are five charts that help explain how England's latest torturous tour of Australia unravelled in just 11 days of cricket...

## Top-order troubles

Despite question marks over Australia's top order leading into the series, they have significantly outperformed their England counterparts - the hosts' top-three batters scoring 666 runs at an average of 41.6 compared to 436 at 24.2 by the tourists.

Of course, this can mostly be attributed to [Australia's masterstroke](https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cy4x2rn7mpxo) borne out of necessity when number five Travis Head was promoted to open in the second innings of the first Test in Perth because of Usman Khawaja's back spasms.

Head hit one of the [all-time great Ashes centuries](https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c98n5nr04jgo) to win the match inside two days and justified his continued promotion to opener with a [sublime 170](https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c3r73y94ppgo) in Adelaide.

Jake Weatherald, who made his debut in Perth, made a vital 72 in Brisbane amid more meagre returns, while number three Marnus Labuschagne has hit two fifties.

Bouncing back from a pair in Perth, England opener Zak Crawley has scored 214 runs in the past two Tests.

But fellow opener Ben Duckett is having a dismal series - 97 runs at 16.16 - while frenetic number three Ollie Pope is not faring much better and could be dropped.

## Failing when trying to launch

England have adopted an aggressive style with the bat since head coach Brendon McCullum took over in 2022 - yes, that word again, 'Bazball'.

Australia have actually scored at a higher run-rate than England so far - 4.34 v 3.78 - and played slightly more attacking shots - 34% compared to 31%.

Those stats can in part be put down to match situations - for example Australia needing only 65 in their second innings in Brisbane and therefore able to attack and reach their target in 10 overs.

The key difference between the sides has been how successful they have been on the attack - Australia's average of 46.9 when playing attacking shots is far better than England's 31.4.

England have shown more willingness to adapt since their second innings in Brisbane, but are struggling in defence too.

The tourists have lost 18 wickets while looking to defend across the series - equivalent to a dismissal every 37 defensive shots. Australia have lost seven such wickets - once in every 64 defensive shots.

## Not enough new-ball wickets

England's hyped - and hyper-fast - pace attack shone in dismissing Australia for 132 in their first innings of the first Test in Perth, but have struggled to be as effective since.

In the first 30 overs of an innings with the new ball, Australia's pace bowlers have taken 32 wickets at an average of 22.8, compared to 23 at 32.2 by England.

## Bowling wrong length

England's declining threat with the new ball could be partly explained by their inability to find the correct length to bowl at on each surface since that first day in Perth.

Complaints from commentators and pundits that England have frequently bowled too short are backed up by comparing the sides' accuracy on hitting a good length - defined as 5-7m from the stumps.

Australia's bowlers have landed 30% of their deliveries in this zone throughout the series, with England doing so just 23% of the time, and have therefore put the tourists' batters under more sustained pressure.

## Catches win Ashes

Even before Marnus Labuschagne decided to have a one-man competition with himself for [screamer of the series,](https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/videos/c7097p1647no) Australia have been clearly superior in the field.

The hosts have taken 47 and dropped eight of 55 chances - a success rate of 85% compared to England's 77% (33 catches, 10 drops).

Half of England's dropped chances happened during a miserable day two of the second Test at the Gabba...
